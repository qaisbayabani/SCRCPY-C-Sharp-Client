# DONT FORGET TO STAR

a single file program.cs converting smooth capture from scrcpy-server to c# client

# program.cs contain code to push an scrcpy-server to mobile phone with adb commands and than running server processes to control the stream sent by mobile phone and reconvert it to movie.

# in program.cs just change the ip in line No.57  to your mobile ip address. 


ps.Arguments = "connect " + "127.0.0.1:5555"; to your mobile ip address.

TURN ON DEVELOPER OPTIONS ON YOUR MOBILE TO USE SCRCPY

install nuget package opencv sharp and opencv runtime from visual studio (2022 cummunity at my side).

put scrcpy-server-v1.13 in your visual studio projects bin/debug

download android sdk plateform tools from https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools and unzip or copy all files in visual studio projects bin/debug

copy program.cs file

change the name of namespace according to ur environment.

run

may have to change the adb commands according to your own environment.


# The code in program.cs covers the following subject is C# programming language.

multithreading


adb commands using c#

server port opening

reading server received data and forwarding the stream to other port.



opencv capture from network stream and decode H264 stream from android screen capture.

cross plateform stuff.

enjoy




# ARTICLE DOWN IS NOT RELTAED TO SCRCPY

Solved not published because Business is business and a cup of tea is a cup of tea.


# IF YOU WANT TO DO IT WITHOUT DEVELOPER OPTIONS THAN

A pc client and mobile phone server is written by me is consists of two following files

 clientformyserver.cs contain PC client

# Sra6.java is using A Mobile trying to connect to a server running on PC.

 sra6.java contain server written by me delivering screen capture of mobile phone screen TO the pc client WIOTHOUT USING ADB OR DEVELOPER OPTIONS OF MOBILE. This server has teChnically killed the SCRCPY which needs ADB/Developer Options.



# MY SERVER SRA6.JAVA WORKS FOR ANDROID 8 SDK 27. FOR SDK 28 TO 34 ANDROID 9 TO 14 THE TECHNIQUE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND IS AVAILABLE ON REQUEST.
